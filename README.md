# rusty-map-view
A map visualizer for Hollow Knight [Randomizer 4](https://github.com/homothetyhk/RandomizerMod) transition randomizer.<br>
Heavily inspired by [TangledMapView](https://github.com/sirbrialliance/TangledMapView)

(This is a big WIP, not really ready for general use.)

rusty-map-view itself is NOT a HK mod, it's a dedicated program that runs alongside the game, unlike TangledMapView's built-in web server.<br>
However, you must have [my fork of the TangledMapView mod](https://github.com/PieKing1215/TangledMapView) installed so it can send data from the game to the map viewer.
